# Feature Specification: AI Project Initialization Template Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-npm-ai-npx`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "开发一个基于npm包管理的AI项目初始化模板工具，通过npx一键创建标准化项目结构。核心功能：支持多种项目模板：React Next.js、Node.js API、Vue应用等；基于npm registry的模板包管理，支持版本控制和缓存优化；交互式CLI界面，支持模板选择、版本指定、参数配置；模板包命名规范：@xagi/ai-template-{type}，如@xagi/ai-template-react-next-app；支持语义化版本、私有registry、本地模板包"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: Remove MCP backend service and focus on CLI tool only → A: All MCP server and AI agent integration removed from scope
- Q: Template source approach → A: Focus on npm-based templates with git repository support as alternative

---

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to quickly initialize new projects with standardized structures using npm-based and git-based templates, so that I can start development immediately without manual setup and ensure consistency across projects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to create a new React Next.js project, **When** they run `npx @xagi/create-ai-project`, **Then** they are presented with interactive options to select the React Next.js template, specify version, and configure project parameters.

2. **Given** a developer selects a template from the npm registry, **When** they complete the configuration, **Then** the tool downloads the template package, creates the project structure, and initializes all necessary configuration files.

3. **Given** a developer wants to use a specific template version, **When** they specify the version during configuration, **Then** the tool downloads the exact version and validates compatibility.

4. **Given** a developer wants to use a git-based template, **When** they specify a git repository URL and branch, **Then** the tool clones the repository and uses it as a template source.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the specified template version is not found in the registry?
- How does system handle network connectivity issues during template download?
- What happens when template package validation fails?
- How does system handle conflicts with existing files in the target directory?
- What happens when the user lacks permissions to create files in the target directory?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple project templates including React Next.js, Node.js API, and Vue applications
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide npm registry-based template package management with version control capabilities
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement template caching optimization to reduce download times for repeated usage
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an interactive CLI interface for template selection, version specification, and parameter configuration
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce template package naming convention: @xagi/ai-template-{type}
- **FR-006**: System MUST support semantic versioning for template packages
- **FR-007**: System MUST support private npm registry configurations for template access
- **FR-008**: System MUST support local template package usage for development and testing
- **FR-009**: System MUST support git repository-based templates with branch/tag specification
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate template packages before project creation to ensure integrity
- **FR-011**: System MUST create standardized project structures with all necessary configuration files
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide error handling and recovery mechanisms for failed operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Template Package**: Represents a project template package with metadata, version, and configuration options
- **Project Configuration**: Contains user-specified parameters for project customization
- **Template Registry**: Manages available templates and their versions from various sources
- **Cache Store**: Manages downloaded templates for performance optimization
- **Git Repository**: Represents git-based template sources with branch/tag specifications
