# Tasks: AI Project Initialization Template Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-npm-ai-npx/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack (Node.js, npm, commander.js, inquirer, chalk, ora, simple-git)
   → Extract: project structure (CLI, core, services, models, utils)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 5 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/cli-api.json: Extract 13 endpoints → contract test + implementation tasks
   → research.md: Extract CLI design best practices → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract user scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, Node.js dependencies, CLI configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, performance tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands, template management
   → Integration: caching, validation, file operations, error handling
   → Polish: optimization, documentation, final testing
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Focus on CLI-only functionality (no MCP backend)
- Support both npm-based and git-based templates
- Prioritize performance (<200ms CLI response, <1s template download)

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - cli-api.json → 9 contract test tasks [P] (T006-T014)
   - 9 endpoints → implementation tasks (T042-T050)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 5 entities → model creation tasks [P] (T025-T029)
   - Entity relationships → service layer tasks (T030-T036)

3. **From User Stories**:
   - 4 template types → integration test tasks [P] (T015-T019)
   - Cache management → integration test [P] (T020)
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks (T073)

4. **From Research**:
   - CLI best practices → setup tasks (T001-T005)
   - Performance targets → performance test tasks [P] (T021-T022)
   - Security considerations → security test tasks [P] (T023-T024)

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → CLI → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - TDD enforced: Tests before implementation
