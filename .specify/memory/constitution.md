# XAGI MCP AI Coding Template Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
Every component MUST maintain the highest standards of code quality. Code MUST be clean, readable, maintainable, and follow established patterns. Each file MUST have a single responsibility, clear purpose, and minimal dependencies. Code complexity MUST be justified and documented.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD IS MANDATORY: Tests MUST be written before implementation. All features MUST start with failing tests that validate requirements. Code coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds, and tests MUST include unit, integration, and contract tests. Test names MUST clearly describe expected behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces MUST maintain consistent patterns, behaviors, and interactions. All user-facing components MUST follow established design systems and accessibility standards. User flows MUST be intuitive and predictable across all features and platforms.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All code MUST meet performance benchmarks: response times under 200ms, memory usage within defined limits, and efficient resource utilization. Performance testing MUST be integrated into the development pipeline, and bottlenecks MUST be identified and resolved early.

### V. Security and Compliance
Security MUST be built into every component, not added as an afterthought. All inputs MUST be validated, all outputs MUST be sanitized, and all sensitive data MUST be properly encrypted. Code MUST follow security best practices and comply with relevant regulations.

## Technical Standards

### Architecture and Design
Systems MUST be designed for maintainability, scalability, and testability. Components MUST be loosely coupled with clear interfaces. Architecture patterns MUST be justified and documented.

### Documentation and Communication
All code MUST be self-documenting through clear naming and structure. Complex logic MUST include inline comments explaining the "why" not the "what". Documentation MUST be kept current with code changes.

### Code Review Process
All code changes MUST undergo peer review following constitutional principles. Reviews MUST focus on adherence to standards, test coverage, and overall system health. Feedback MUST be constructive and actionable.

## Development Workflow

### Continuous Integration
All code MUST be continuously integrated with automated builds, tests, and quality checks. Breaking changes MUST be prevented through automated gates and manual verification.

### Version Control Standards
Git workflows MUST follow established patterns with clear branch strategies. Commit messages MUST be descriptive and follow conventional commit standards. Code MUST be committed frequently in small, logical units.

### Error Handling and Logging
All components MUST implement robust error handling with clear user feedback. Structured logging MUST be implemented for debugging and monitoring. Errors MUST be gracefully handled without exposing sensitive information.

## Governance

**Constitutional Supremacy**: This constitution supersedes all other practices and guidelines. All development activities MUST comply with these principles.

**Amendment Process**: Amendments require:
1. Clear documentation of proposed changes
2. Review and approval by maintainers
3. Migration plan for existing code
4. Version increment according to semantic versioning

**Compliance Review**: All code reviews, pull requests, and development activities MUST verify constitutional compliance. Complexity deviations MUST be explicitly justified and documented.

**Versioning Policy**: Follow semantic versioning:
- MAJOR: Backward incompatible changes to principles
- MINOR: New principles or expanded guidance
- PATCH: Clarifications and wording refinements

**Runtime Guidance**: Use `.claude/commands/constitution.md` for development guidance and `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for the authoritative source.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-28 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-28
